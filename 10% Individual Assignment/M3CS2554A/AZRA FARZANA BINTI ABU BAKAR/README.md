# 📊 Parallel Student Attendance Counter

## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the comparison between **three programming techniques**:
- Sequential
- Concurrent (Threading)
- Parallel (Multiprocessing)

The system processes a large dataset of student attendance (over 300,000 records) and measures execution time for each technique.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- To understand differences between sequential, concurrent, and parallel programming  
- To implement all three techniques using Python  
- To analyze performance when handling large-scale data  
- To visualize execution time using a graph  

---

## ⚙️ Techniques Explanation

### 1. Sequential Processing
Sequential processing executes tasks **one by one** using a single flow.

✔ Processes all data one by one 

❌ No concurrency or parallelism 

❌ Simple but slower for large data 

---

### 2. Concurrent Processing (Threading)
Threading allows multiple tasks to run **at the same time (logically)**.

✔ Splits data into parts 

✔ Suitable for I/O-based tasks 

✔ Uses multiple threads to process simultaneously

---

### 3. Parallel Processing (Multiprocessing)
Multiprocessing uses **multiple CPU cores** to run tasks simultaneously.

✔ Uses multiple CPU cores

✔ Processes data in parallel

✔ Best for heavy workloads

## 📥 Input Used

```
Present: 276500 
Absent: 24300 
```

---

## 📤 Output Result

```
Total Students: 300800
Processing... please wait.

Sequential Time: 1.5147 seconds
Threading Time: 0.3845 seconds
Multiprocessing Time: 0.4297 seconds

--- Results ---
Present : 276500
Absent : 24300

Fastest method: Threading
```

---

## 📈 Performance Analysis

- Sequential is slower because it processes data one by one  
- Threading is faster because it runs tasks concurrently  
- Multiprocessing is slightly slower than threading in this case due to process overhead  

👉 Therefore, **Threading is the fastest method for this dataset**

---

## 📈 Graph Visualization

The system generates a bar chart to compare execution time between:
- Sequential  
- Threading  
- Multiprocessing  

📌  *Graph image is shown below.*

## 🧾 Conclusion

This project shows that different programming techniques have different performance depending on the workload.

For this dataset, Threading performed the best, proving that concurrent programming can significantly improve performance in certain scenarios.
