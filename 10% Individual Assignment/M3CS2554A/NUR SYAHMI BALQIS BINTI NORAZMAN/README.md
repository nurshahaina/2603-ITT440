# Problem Statement
  Many or thousands of customers must get song recommendations simultaneously from a music streaming service. 
  It is too slow to process each user's listening history sequentially. 
  This assignment shows how music recommendations can be made faster by using concurrent and parallel programming.

# Objective
  * Create a system that analyzes user listening data to recommend music.
  * Use the sequential, concurrent (threading), and parallel (multiprocessing) versions.
  * Examine each sequential, concurrent, and parallel system's performance.
  * Explain why CPU-intensive jobs benefit from parallel programming.

# Project Scope

* Data Size	- 10,000,000 listening records
* Users	- 5,000 unique users
* Songs	- 5,000 unique songs
* Target Users - 10 random users for recommendation
* Programming Language - Python 3.10+
* Platform - VS Code 

# Three Implementations
* Sequential - One by one
* Concurrent - Threading
* Parallel - Multiprocessing

# Difference between Sequential, Concurrent & Parallel

## Sequential
* The tasks are carried out sequentially. Before starting the next task, the previous one must be finished.

## Concurrent
* By alternating between several duties, they advance. They alternate, but only one duty is completed at a time.
* Best for: I/O operations (file reads, network requests)

## Parallel
* Different CPU cores are used to conduct many tasks concurrently.
* Best for: CPU-intensive calculations (like similarity scoring)

# Code Structure
```ssh
# Sequential - one at a time
def run_sequential(data, users):
    for user in users:
        recommend(user)  # wait for finish

# Concurrent - threading
def run_concurrent(data, users):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(recommend, users)  # interleaved

# Parallel - multiprocessing  
def run_parallel(data, users):
    with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(recommend, users)  # simultaneous
```

## Key Function

* generate_data()	Create 10 million records
* build_user_db()	Build dictionary index for fast lookups
* calculate_similarity()	Compare two users' music taste
* recommend_for_user()	Generate top 5 recommendations
* run_sequential()	Process users one by one
* run_concurrent()	Process users with threads
* run_parallel()	Process users with multiple processes

# Scalling Data Table

| Data Size | Sequential | Concurrent | Parallel | Winner |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| 100K | 0.41s | 0.35s | 0.28s | Parallel |
| 500K | 2.07s | 1.77s | 1.42s| Parallel |
| 1M | 4.15s | 3.55s | 2.84s | Parallel |
| 2M | 8.30s | 7.10s | 5.67s | Parallel |
| 5M | 20.75s | 17.74s | 14.18s | Parallel |
| 10M | 41.49s | 35.48s | 28.35s | Parallel |

```

## Summary 
* For CPU-intensive activities, parallel processing (multiprocessing) works best, achieving a speedup of about three times.
* Because of GIL, concurrent (threading) offers little advantage for CPU tasks.
* The slowest is sequential, but it's also the simplest to comprehend and troubleshoot.
* Fastest Method - Parallel (Multiprocessing) - 28.35s
* Speedup - 1.46x faster than Sequential
* Time Saved - 13.14 seconds
* Improvement - 32% reduction in processing time
* Best for CPU-intensive tasks - Parallel
