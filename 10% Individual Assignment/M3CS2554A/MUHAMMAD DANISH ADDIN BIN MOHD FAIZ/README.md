## 📌 Overview
This project demonstrates the use of **parallel programming in Python** to clean and process large-scale CSV datasets efficiently.

The system compares three execution methods:
- Sequential Processing
- Concurrent Processing (Threading)
- Parallel Processing (Multiprocessing)

---

## ❗ Problem Statement
In modern applications, large datasets often contain incomplete, inconsistent, or invalid data that must be cleaned before use.Despite the availability of concurrency and parallel programming approaches, it is not always evident which approach offers the best performance for big datasets. Specifically, Python adds new difficulties like the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL), which can reduce the efficiency of threading for CPU-bound operations.
In order to find the best way to improve speed, this research compares sequential, concurrent (threading), and parallel (multiprocessing) techniques to the challenge of effectively cleaning huge CSV datasets.

---

## 🎯 Objectives
- Process and clean large datasets (millions of records)
- Apply different programming techniques
- Compare execution performance
- Analyze how data size affects efficiency

## System Environment

| Parameter | Details |
|---|---|
| OS | Windows 11 |
| Python Version | Python 3.14 |
| IDE | Visual Studio Code |
| CPU Cores | Auto-detected |

---

## ⚙️ Features
- Generate up to **10 million dirty records**
- Clean and validate:
  - Email
  - Age
  - Salary
  - Phone number
  - Name formatting
- Detect invalid data issues
- Performance benchmarking (time + speedup)
- Export cleaned CSV files

## 🧠 Techniques Used

###  Sequential
```
1. Loop one by one
2. Clean record
3. Store result
```

###  Threading (Concurrent)
```
1. Split data
2. Use threads
3. Process chunks concurrently
4. Limited by Python GIL
```

###  Multiprocessing (Parallel)
```
1. Split data into chunks
2. Send chunks to multiple CPU cores
3. Each core runs clean_chunk()
4. Combine all results
```

## Code Structure

### Parallel cleaner (MULTIPROCESSING)
```
def run_parallel(records: list[dict]):
    print(f"\n[PARALLEL] Multiprocessing Cleaner  ({NUM_WORKERS} cores, chunk={CHUNK_SIZE:,})")
    start = time.time()

    chunks = [records[i:i + CHUNK_SIZE] for i in range(0, len(records), CHUNK_SIZE)]
    print(f"[PARALLEL] {len(chunks)} chunks dispatched across {NUM_WORKERS} processes")

    with multiprocessing.Pool(processes=NUM_WORKERS) as pool:
        chunked_results = pool.map(clean_chunk, chunks)

    # Flatten list-of-lists
    results = [r for batch in chunked_results for r in batch]

    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"[PARALLEL] Completed in {elapsed:.2f}s")
    return results, elapsed
```
### Sequential cleaner
```
def run_sequential(records: list[dict]):
    print("\n[SEQUENTIAL] Cleaning records...")
    start   = time.time()
    results = [clean_record(r) for r in records]
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"[SEQUENTIAL] Completed in {elapsed:.2f}s")
    return results, elapsed
```
###  Threading cleaner
```
def run_concurrent(records: list[dict]):
    print("\n[CONCURRENT] Threading Cleaner...")
    start   = time.time()
    # Fewer, fatter chunks for threads too — reduces scheduler overhead
    t_chunk = max(100_000, len(records) // NUM_WORKERS)
    chunks  = [records[i:i + t_chunk] for i in range(0, len(records), t_chunk)]
    results = []
    with ThreadPoolExecutor(max_workers=NUM_WORKERS) as ex:
        futures = [ex.submit(clean_chunk, c) for c in chunks]
        for f in futures:
            results.extend(f.result())
    elapsed = time.time() - start
    print(f"[CONCURRENT] Completed in {elapsed:.2f}s")
    return results, elapsed
```
