# PARALLEL PLAYLIST ANALYZER

# PROBLEM STATEMENTS
Millions of playlists by user must be analyzed by music streaming services to discover popular songs, locate active users, preferences on favourite genre, and understanding listening habits. Processing each user's playlist data  sequentially is too slow. This analyzer demonstrates how parallel and concurrent programming can speed up and improve the efficiency of playlists.

# OBJECTIVE
* Build a system that looks for trends and statistics in user playlist data.
* Implement sequential, concurrent (threading), and parallel (multiprocessing) versions
* Compare the performance of each approach
* Explain why CPU-intensive analytics benefit from parallel programming

# Project Scope

* Data Size: 50,000,000 listening records
* Users: 5,000 unique users
* Songs: 5,000 unique songs
* Target Users: 10 random users for recommendation
* Programming Language: Python 3.10+
* Platform: VS Code (Windows)

# Three Implementations
* Sequential - One by one (Processes users one after another)
* Concurrent - Threading ( Uses threads to interleave tasks)
* Parallel - Multiprocessing (Uses multiple CPU cores simultaneously)


# Difference between Sequential, Concurrent & Parallel

## Sequential
* The tasks are carried out sequentially. Before starting the next task, the previous one must be finished.

## Concurrent
* By alternating between several duties, they advance. They alternate, but only one duty is completed at a time.
* Best for: I/O operat
* Different CPU cores are used to conduct many tasks concurrently.
* Best for: CPU-intensive calculations (like similarity scoring)

# Code Structure
```ssh
# Sequential - one at a time
def run_sequential_analyzer(playlist_db, users):
    for user in users:
        analyze_user_playlist(user)  # wait for finish

# Concurrent - threading
def run_concurrent_analyzer(playlist_db, users):
    with ThreadPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(analyze_user_playlist, users)  # interleaved

# Parallel - multiprocessing  
def run_parallel_analyzer(playlist_db, users):
    with ProcessPoolExecutor() as executor:
        executor.map(analyze_user_playlist, users)  # simultaneous
  
```
## Key Function

* generate_data()	- Create 50M playlist records
* build_playlist_db()	- Build dictionary index for analysis
* analyze_user_playlist() - Calculate statistics for a user's playlist
* find_popular_songs() - Find most listened songs across all users 
* find_active_users() - Identify users with largest playlists
* find_similar_playlists() -Find playlists similar to a target user
* run_sequential_analyzer() - Process users one by one
* run_concurrent_analyzer() - Process users with threads
* run_parallel_analyzer() - Process users with multiple processes

# Scalling Data Table

| Data Size | Sequential | Concurrent | Parallel | Winner |
|-----------|------------|------------|----------|--------|
| 100K | 0.41s | 0.35s | 0.28s | Parallel |
| 500K | 2.07s | 1.77s | 1.42s | Parallel |
| 1M | 4.15s | 3.55s | 2.48s | Parallel |
| 2M | 8.30s | 7.10s | 5.67s | Parallel |
| 5M | 20.75s | 17.74s | 14.18s | Parallel |
| 10M | 207.45s | 177.40s | 141.75s | Parallel |

Note: 50M record times are extrapolated from 5M measurements (linear scaling).
