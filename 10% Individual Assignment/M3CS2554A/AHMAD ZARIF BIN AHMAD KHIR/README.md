## ❗ 1. Problem Statement

Stock markets generate enormous volumes of price data every second. Analyzing thousands of stocks with hundreds of price ticks each is computationally expensive. This project investigates whether *Threading* or *Multiprocessing* can outperform traditional *Sequential* processing for this CPU-bound workload.

The program simulates up to *1,000,000+ data points* and benchmarks all three approaches.

### 3.2 Function Description

| Function | Purpose |
|---|---|
| make_stocks(num, ticks) | Creates fake stock data. Each stock has a list of prices that change randomly over time. |
| calc(name, prices) | Analyzes one stock and calculates all important values like average price, min, max, volatility, and return.|
| calc_item(item) | Helps convert data into the correct format so it can be used in threading and multiprocessing.|
| do_sequential(stocks) | Processes all stocks one by one (no parallelism). Used as the baseline for comparison. |
| do_threading(stocks) | Processes stocks using multiple threads to try to speed up execution.|
| _chunked(items, size) | Splits the data into smaller groups (chunks) to make multiprocessing more efficient. |
| mp_chunk_work(chunk) | Processes one chunk of stocks in a separate process. |
| do_multiprocessing(stocks) | Uses multiple CPU cores to process stocks in parallel, making it faster. |
| set_one_million_data() | Automatically sets the number of stocks and ticks to reach around 1 million data points.|
| ui_queue | Sends data safely from background tasks to the GUI without causing errors.|
| Chart class | Displays results visually in the GUI using charts. |
| App class | Controls the whole application, including GUI, user input, and running simulations. |

### 5.3 Analysis

#### Sequential
Processes stocks one by one without using threads or processes. It has no extra overhead, so it performs well for small datasets. However, it becomes slower when the data size increases.

#### Threading (ThreadPoolExecutor)
Uses multiple threads to process stocks at the same time. However, Python’s GIL (Global Interpreter Lock) allows only one thread to run at a time for CPU tasks. Because of this limitation and thread overhead, threading is slightly slower than sequential for this project.

#### Multiprocessing (Chunked Pool.map)
Uses multiple processes, where each process runs on a separate CPU core. This allows true parallel execution and avoids the GIL limitation. As a result, multiprocessing achieves better performance and is the fastest method in this project.

## 6. Conclusion

| Rank | Method | Best Time | Speedup | Notes |
|---|---|---|---|---|
| 1 | *Multiprocessing* | 0.521s | *1.20x* | Fastest — bypasses GIL |
| 2 | Sequential | 0.626s | 1.00x | Baseline — zero overhead |
| 3 | Threading | 0.725s | 0.86x | Slower — GIL limited |

Multiprocessing is the fastest method for this project because it uses multiple CPU cores and runs tasks in parallel. This allows it to process large data more efficiently.

Sequential execution provides a stable baseline and performs well for smaller datasets since it has no extra overhead.

Threading is slower for this project because of Python’s GIL, which limits true parallel execution for CPU-based tasks.

For future improvement, this project can be extended by using real-time data and combining multiprocessing with asynchronous programming for better performance.
