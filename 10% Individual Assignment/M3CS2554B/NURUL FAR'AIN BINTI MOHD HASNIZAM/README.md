# Requirements
- Python 3.13
- VS Code

# Introduction
This project aims to examine the performance differences between three different data processing methods in Python: Sequential, Concurrent (Threading), and Parallel (Multiprocessing). We utilize mathematical power calculations ($n^2$ to $n^5$) on a large dataset to evaluate the efficiency of each approach in managing CPU-intensive workloads.

# Problem Statement
In large-scale data processing, the Sequential method is often time-consuming because it utilizes only a single CPU core at a time. Although Concurrent (Threading) is available, it is frequently restricted by Python's Global Interpreter Lock (GIL) when handling CPU-intensive tasks. Consequently, we must identify the most efficient method to accelerate heavy data computations.

# Objectives
- Implementing mathematical power calculations using three programming paradigms.
- Analyzing the execution time for each method.
- Generating data reports in .csv format and performance visualizations via bar charts.
- Proving that parallel processing is the fastest approach for CPU-oriented tasks.

# System Requirements
- Operating System : Window / Linux / macOS
- Language : Python 3.13
- Libraries : matplotlib (Visualitation), pandas, csv, time, threading, multiprocessing
- Hardware : CPU with at least 4 logical processors / cores for optimal results

# Conclusion
In conclusion, for tasks involving heavy mathematical computations (CPU-bound tasks), utilizing Parallel Processing (Multiprocessing) is the optimal choice. While Concurrent (Threading) is effective for I/O-bound tasks, it is not comparable to the performance of Parallel processing in the context of large-scale data computation in Python.
