# INTRODUCTION 
This project focuses on the implementation and performance evaluation of parallel programming techniques using Python. The task involves classifying a massive dataset of **5,000,000 numeric records** into three distinct categories (Category A, B, and C) based on CPU-bound mathematical logic. This project demonstrates how hardware resources can be optimized to reduce execution time in data-heavy environments. 

Three distinct categories:

**Category A:** Result of calculation > 500

**Category B:** Result of calculation > 200

**Category C:** Result of calculation ≤ 200

# PROBLEM STATEMENT 
In traditional sequential programming, tasks are processed one after another using only a single CPU core. When dealing with millions of data points, this creates a significant performance bottleneck, leaving modern multi-core processors underutilized. This project addresses the inefficiency of single-threaded execution by implementing **Multiprocessing** allowing the workload to be distributed across all available logical processors. 

# SYSTEM SPECIFICATIONS 
The analysis was conducted on a high-performance laptop with the following specifications:

-**Processor:** AMD Ryzen 5 7535HS 

-**Architecture:** 6 Physical Cores, 12 Logical Processors

-**Base Speed:** 3.30 GHz

-**Memory (RAM):** 8.0 GB 

-**Operating System:** Windows 11

# METHODOLOGY 
The classification logic involves complex mathematical operations to simulate a heavy CPU-bound workload. Three approaches were compared:

1. **Sequential:** Using a standard 'for' loop (Single core).
2. **Threading:** Using 'ThreadPoolExecutor' (Concurrency).
3. **Multiprocessing:** Using 'ProcessPoolExecutor' (True Parallelism).

RESULTS: Parallelism is 1.60x faster than Sequential


# CONCLUSION 
The results clearly indicate that Multiprocessing is the superior approach for CPU-bound tasks in Python. While Threading offers slight improvements, it is still hindered by the GIL. Multiprocessing effectively distributed the 5 million data points across all 12 logical processors, proving that hardware-aware programming is essential for large-scale data science and engineering tasks.
